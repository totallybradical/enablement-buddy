# webexteamsbot
This package makes creating [Webex Teams](https://www.webex.com/products/teams/index.html) bots in Python super simple.  

[![PyPI version](https://badge.fury.io/py/webexteamsbot.svg)](https://badge.fury.io/py/webexteamsbot)

> This package is based on the previous [ciscosparkbot](https://github.com/imapex/ciscosparkbot) project.  This version will both move to new Webex Teams branding as well as add new functionality.  If you've used `ciscosparkbot` you will find this package very similar and familiar.  

# Prerequisites

If you don't already have a [Webex Teams](https://www.webex.com/products/teams/index.html) account, go ahead and [register](https://www.webex.com/pricing/free-trial.html) for one.  They are free.

1. You'll need to start by adding your bot to the Webex Teams website.

    [https://developer.webex.com/my-apps](https://developer.webex.com/my-apps)

1. Click **Create a New App**

    ![add-app](https://github.com/hpreston/webexteamsbot/raw/master/images/newapp.jpg)

1. Click **Create a Bot**.

    ![create-bot](https://github.com/hpreston/webexteamsbot/raw/master/images/createbot.jpg)

2. Fill out all the details about your bot.  You'll need to set a name, username, icon (either upload one or choose a sample), and provide a description.

    ![add-bot](https://github.com/hpreston/webexteamsbot/raw/master/images/newbot.jpg)

3. Click **Add Bot**.

1. On the Congratulations screen, make sure to copy the *Bot's Access Token*, you will need this in a second.

    ![enter-details](https://github.com/hpreston/webexteamsbot/raw/master/images/botcongrats.jpg)

# Installation

> Python 3.6+ is recommended.  Python 2.7 should also work.  

1. Create a virtualenv and install the module

    ```
    python3.6 -m venv venv
    source venv/bin/activate
    pip install webexteamsbot
    ```

# Usage

1. The easiest way to use this module is to set a few environment variables

    > Note: See [ngrok](#ngrok) for details on setting up an easy HTTP tunnel for development.

    ```
    export TEAMS_BOT_URL=https://mypublicsite.io
    export TEAMS_BOT_TOKEN=<your bots token>
    export TEAMS_BOT_EMAIL=<your bots email>
    export TEAMS_BOT_APP_NAME=<your bots name>
    ```

1. A basic bot requires very little code to get going.  

    ```python
    import os
    from webexteamsbot import TeamsBot

    # Retrieve required details from environment variables
    bot_email = os.getenv("TEAMS_BOT_EMAIL")
    teams_token = os.getenv("TEAMS_BOT_TOKEN")
    bot_url = os.getenv("TEAMS_BOT_URL")
    bot_app_name = os.getenv("TEAMS_BOT_APP_NAME")

    # Create a Bot Object
    bot = TeamsBot(
        bot_app_name,
        teams_bot_token=teams_token,
        teams_bot_url=bot_url,
        teams_bot_email=bot_email,
    )


    # A simple command that returns a basic string that will be sent as a reply
    def do_something(incoming_msg):
        """
        Sample function to do some action.
        :param incoming_msg: The incoming message object from Teams
        :return: A text or markdown based reply
        """
        return "i did what you said - {}".format(incoming_msg.text)


    # Add new commands to the box.
    bot.add_command("/dosomething", "help for do something", do_something)


    if __name__ == "__main__":
        # Run Bot
        bot.run(host="0.0.0.0", port=5000)
    ```

1. A [sample script](https://github.com/hpreston/webexteamsbot/blob/master/sample.py) that shows more advanced bot features and customization is also provided in the repo.  


# ngrok

[ngrok](http://ngrok.com) will make easy for you to develop your code with a live bot.

You can find installation instructions here: [https://ngrok.com/download](https://ngrok.com/download)

1. After you've installed `ngrok`, in another window start the service

    ```
    ngrok http 5000
    ```

1. You should see a screen that looks like this:

    ```
    ngrok by @inconshreveable                                                                                                                                 (Ctrl+C to quit)

    ```
    export TEAMS_BOT_URL=https://this.is.the.url.you.need

    ```

## Local Development

If you have an idea for a feature you would like to see, we gladly accept pull requests.  To get started developing, simply run the following..

```
git clone https://github.com/hpreston/webexteamsbot
cd webexteamsbot
pip install -r requirements_dev.txt
python setup.py develop
```

### Linting

We use flake 8 to lint our code. Please keep the repository clean by running:

```
flake8
```

### Testing

Tests are located in the [tests](./tests) directory.

To run the tests in the `tests` folder, you can run the following command
from the project root.

```
coverage run --source=webexteamsbot setup.py test
coverage html
```

This will generate a code coverage report in a directory called `htmlcov`
